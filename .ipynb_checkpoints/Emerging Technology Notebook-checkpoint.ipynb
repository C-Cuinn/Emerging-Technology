    "### Population Deviation assumes that the data given represents the entire population of a test group with no care given to outliers or inherent bias present in the data. Sample Deviation on the other hand modifies the formula by N-1 (or (len(x)**-1**)). For calculating the standard deviation of a sample of data the **Bessel’s correction** is applied to the size of the data sample (N) as a result of which 1 is subtracted from the sample size. The idea is that the calculation of standard deviation of sample includes a little bias due to the fact that the deviation is calculated based on the sample mean rather than the population mean. Thus, the bias is removed by subtracting 1 from the sample size.\n",
