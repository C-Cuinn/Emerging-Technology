Emerging Technology Y4 Tasks

Task 1 : Square Root of 2
    This task was to "Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and
prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places." This program uses the Babalonian Method to refine an estimate to 100 decimal places.


Task 2 : The Chi-Squared Test 
    This task was to "Use scipy.stats to verify a value and calculate the associated p value." using a provided dataset.

Task 3 : Population Deviation VS Sample Deviation
    This task was to "Research these (aforementioned) Excel functions, writing a note in a Markdown cell about the difference between them. Then use numpy to perform a simulation demonstrating that the STDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standarddeviation of a population when performed on a sample"

Task 4 : SciKit Learn
This task was to "Use scikit-learn to apply k-means clustering to
Fisherâ€™s famous Iris data set."
